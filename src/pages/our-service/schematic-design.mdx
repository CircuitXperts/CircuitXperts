        <div className=" mt-4 mt-lg-5">
          Schematic design is a crucial phase in electronic circuit design where
          the structure and connections of a circuit are defined using
          standardized symbols. It serves as a blueprint for creating electronic
          circuits and is essential for design, testing, and manufacturing.

        <ul className="mt-4 mt-lg-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Component Symbols:</strong> Symbols represent electronic
            components such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits
            (ICs).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connections:</strong> Nets and buses show how components are
            electrically connected.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annotations:</strong> Labels and values that provide details
            about components, like resistance or capacitance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Design Rules:</strong> Electrical Rules Check (ERC) ensures
            the schematic adheres to design standards and constraints.

        <h2 className="head-text pb-1">How to Create a Schematic Design</h2>
        <ol className="mt-4 mt-lg-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Gather Requirements:</strong> Understand the circuit
            requirements and specifications before starting the design.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Component Symbols:</strong> Draw or select symbols
            for all electronic components using a schematic design tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Place Components:</strong> Position the symbols on the
            schematic sheet according to the circuit layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect Components:</strong> Use nets to draw connections
            between the components, ensuring the correct electrical pathways.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Annotate the Design:</strong> Add labels and values to each
            component to provide necessary details and facilitate understanding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify the Design:</strong> Perform Electrical Rules Check
            (ERC) to ensure there are no design errors or rule violations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simulate the Circuit:</strong> Use simulation tools to test
            the circuit behavior and validate its performance before physical
            implementation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Document the Design:</strong> Generate documentation for the
            schematic to serve as a reference for assembly, testing, and future
            modifications.
          </li>
