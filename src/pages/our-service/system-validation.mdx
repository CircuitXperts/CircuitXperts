          <h2 className="pb-2 fw-bold h3 text-orange pt-lg-6">System Validation</h2>
          <div className="pt-3">
            System Validation is a critical phase in the development cycle, ensuring that the system operates
            according to its design specifications and meets the requirements of its intended use. This phase confirms
            the performance, functionality, and reliability of the system as a whole, focusing on key areas like System
            Integration, Design Verification, and Testing.
          </div>
          <h2 className="text-sub pt-4 pt-lg-5">System Integration</h2>
          <div className="pt-3">
            System Integration is the process of combining different modules or components
            (hardware, software, and firmware) into a unified system. During this phase,
            individual subsystems are tested for compatibility and communication with each
            other. Effective integration ensures that all components function together as
            intended.
          </div>
          <ul className="pt-3">
            <li>
              <strong>Interfacing Components:</strong> Ensure seamless interaction between
              hardware, firmware, and software modules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Flow Validation:</strong> Confirm that data is correctly
              transmitted between components, without losses or miscommunication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resolving Conflicts:</strong> Identify and resolve conflicts between
              subsystems, including timing, power, or resource allocation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Perform tests on the combined
              subsystems to ensure they work together under real-world conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <h2 className="text-sub pt-4 pt-lg-5">Design Verification</h2>
        <div className="pt-3">
          Design Verification ensures that the design meets the initial specifications
          before moving to production. It involves validating the system's architecture
          and functionality through simulation, modeling, and analysis. This phase
          focuses on detecting design errors or inconsistencies early to minimize
          downstream issues.
        </div>
        <ul className="pt-3">
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Requirement Verification:</strong> Ensure the design aligns with all
            system requirements, including functional, electrical, and mechanical
            specifications.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Simulation & Modeling:</strong> Use software tools to simulate how
            the system will perform under different conditions, validating its behavior
            and performance.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Power & Signal Integrity Analysis:</strong> Ensure that power
            distribution and signal integrity are maintained across the design.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Design Compliance:</strong> Validate that the design complies with
            industry standards, regulatory guidelines, and safety protocols.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-sub pt-4 pt-lg-5">Testing</h2>
        <div className="pt-3">
          Testing is a vital step to ensure that the system functions correctly and
          reliably under various conditions. It covers multiple types of tests,
          including functional, performance, and stress testing, to evaluate the
          system's robustness. The goal is to identify any remaining issues before
          deployment.
        </div>
        <ul className="pt-3">
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Verifies that the system meets the
            functional requirements and performs tasks as expected.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Evaluates the system's speed,
            efficiency, and scalability, ensuring it performs optimally under different
            loads.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Assesses how the system behaves under
            extreme conditions, such as high traffic or resource strain, ensuring
            stability and fault tolerance.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-1">
            <strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Tests the system's ability to recover from
            failures, validating redundancy and recovery mechanisms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div className="pt-3 text-sub">
          In conclusion, System Validation is a comprehensive process that ensures the final product is reliable,
          scalable, and ready for deployment. By focusing on System Integration, Design Verification, and Testing,
          organizations can reduce risks, improve performance, and ensure compliance with industry standards.
