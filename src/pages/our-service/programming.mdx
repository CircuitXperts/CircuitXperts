          Programming is essential in electronics design, where software tools
          and techniques are used to develop, simulate, and verify electronic
          systems. This includes writing code for embedded systems, designing
          electronic circuits, and using software tools to enhance the design
          process.

        <div className=" pt-2 pt-lg-3 pb-2">
          Hardware Programming involves coding that directly interacts with
          physical components, enabling the control and configuration of devices
          at a low level. It is crucial for systems that require direct
          manipulation of hardware, including embedded systems,
          microcontrollers, and programmable logic devices like FPGAs
          (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays).
